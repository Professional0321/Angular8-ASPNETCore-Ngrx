# ASP.NET / ASP.NET Core WebAPI AngularJS / Angular Demo with Component based design, Webpack, Ahead-of-Time (Aot) Compilation, Lazy Loading and Treeshaking runnable on every Platform (Cross Platform)

This repository offers you one demo application implemented three times (AngularJS, Angular with SystemJS and Angular with Webpack) with two compatible endpoints implemented in ASP.NET & ASP.NET Core served to run on every platform (Cross Platform)

The application comes with lazy loading, forms, custom validation, routing etc.

Server and Client are completely seperated that you can exchange the endpoint easily.

### Check the corresponding package.json for the npm commands to start the repository
